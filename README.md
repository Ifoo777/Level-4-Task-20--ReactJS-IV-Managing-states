# Level-4-Task-20--ReactJS-IV-Managing-states

## Task

Create a React app that simulates the Monty Hall problem.

○ The user should be shown three doors that they can click. 

One of the three doors is a winning door, and the other two are losing doors. I.e. the user wishes to pick the winning door, but which one is unknown (random). 

You can put a pot of gold behind the winning door, or whatever you choose as the prize.

○ When the user clicks on a door it should be marked selected. It should not be opened yet.

○ Following this, one of the other two doors that is a losing door should be opened. I.e. at this point one door is selected, one losing door is open, and one door is closed.

○ The user must now be allowed to open either one of the two closed doors. This is their final decision.

○ Their chosen door should open to reveal whether it is the winning door or not.

○ The user must be able to reset the game at any time and start over.

(Fun fact) If you program the probabilities correctly (winning door is random each play) the winning door will be the opposite of the initially selected door about 2/3rds of the time. Many statisticians are still dumbfounded by this. Test it out to see if it feels true.
